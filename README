Short description

Gedit Technology - Source code editing widget

Longer description
------------------

libgedit-gtksourceview is part of
[Gedit Technology](https://gedit-technology.net/).

libgedit-gtksourceview is a library that extends GtkTextView, the standard GTK
widget for multiline text editing. This library adds support for syntax
highlighting, undo/redo, file loading and saving, search and replace, a
completion system, printing, displaying line numbers, and other features typical
of a source code editor.

Dependencies
------------

- GTK 3
- libxml2

Installation
------------

Simple install procedure from a tarball:

```
$ ./configure
$ make
[ Become root if necessary ]
$ make install
```

See the file `INSTALL` for more detailed information.

From the Git repository, the `configure` script and the `INSTALL` file are not
yet generated, so you need to run `autogen.sh` instead, which takes the same
arguments as `configure`.
